cmsdas2014
==========

This is the Central repository for the CMS DAS @CERN 2014 exercises as discussed in the CMG meeting on Dec 6, 2013.

Each exercise goes into a separate subdirectory.

It would probably make sense if you would create a branch named like the subdirectory and push this in your pull request - this way the students can check out individual exercises as they go.
We can make an "all" branch and merge all branches once things are stable a few days before the school starts (Jan 9, 2014). 

Please note that the repository is supposed to be used as the only one in a CMSSW developers area, so if you need to checkout and modify any CMSSW package in addition to the exercise itself, it will need more work (in that case let me know asap.). My assumption so far was that the exercises do not need any CMSSW package to be checked out, only the exercise code itself.
